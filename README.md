# ZXText2P

A modified version of ZXText2P to add a `-d` option to collapse the display file in the P file so that it can fit on a 1K ZX81.
From [chapter 27 of the ZX81 manual](http://otremolet.free.fr/otnet/otzx/zx81/basic-progr/chap27.html):

> When the total amount of memory (according to the system variable RAMTOP) is less than 3 1/4 K, then a clear screen - as set up at the start or by **CLS** - consists of just twenty five **NEWLINE**s. When the memory is bigger than a clear screen is padded out with 24\*32 spaces

The original ZXText2P can be found at http://freestuff.grok.co.uk/zxtext2p/index.html.
